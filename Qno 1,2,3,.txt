1 Which of the following(s) is/are true about bubble sort:

 (i) It is stable sort
 (ii) It has a worst case space complexity of O(n)
 (iii) It involves swapping of adjacent elements
 (iv) After each iteration, the greatest element is placed at the end of the array.

 Answer: i,iii,iv.
 For ii part time complexity is O(n^2) not O(n).

2 What will the following array look like after one iteration of bubble sort [1,6,2,5,4,3].

(i) [1,3,2,4,5,6]
(ii) [1,2,3,4,5,6]
(iii) [1,2,5,4,3,6]
(iv) [1,2,4,5,3,6]

Answer: iii part

3 In which case does bubble sort works in the most efficient way:

(i) When the array is sorted in increasing order
(ii) When the array is sorted partially
(iii) When the array is sorted in decreasing order.
(iv) When the array is nearly sorted.
Answer is : i, As no swap will happen therfore only one pass is required.
